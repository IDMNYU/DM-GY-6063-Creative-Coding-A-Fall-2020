## Week 1 - Selfie or Sol
  * Selfie - Using primitives like arcs, rectangles, and ellipses create a self portrait and post a link to it on your class blog 
  * Sol Lewitt drawing exercise. As precisely as possible, follow the instructions of one Sol Lewitt wall drawing text and translate it into p5.js code to produce the drawing. Look at [Solving Sol](https://solvingsol.com) as a reference and for inspiration. Choose one wall drawing text from the following list, write the code and post a link to the project on your class blog:
      * Wall Drawing #65 (1971): Lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density,
covering the entire surface of the wall.
      * Wall Drawing #396 (1983): A black five-pointed star, a yellow six-pointed star, a red seven-pointed star, and a blue eight-pointed star, drawn in color and India ink washes.
      * Wall Drawing # 915 (1999): Arcs, circle, and irregular bands.
