**No Class September 9, classes run on a Monday schedule**    
**I will be sending you videos to watch before class on Sept 16**

* **WEEK 2 - September 16**
  * pre-work
    * watch [videos on variables, conditionals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnkvii1uWBvFCo84lUMwR2Sgxe1yWOt6Z)
    * optional video on [local development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTGebvhZ4kk)

  * animation, and time discussion
  * link of the week - [For Your Processing](https://fyprocessing.tumblr.com/)
  * _Assignment_
    * Watch the [videos on loops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnkvii1uWBvFPvNnW66SU9u5T1a35eKRp)
    * Watch the [videos  on functions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnkvii1uWBvG7DY6mCeW3Yn6IdmQ8qm1V)
    * Optional but encouraged [videos on translation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnkvii1uWBvE1LbyWKMRtoLC2XaIcN8gN)
    * **Read** [p5.js Tutorial on interaction](https://p5js.org/learn/interactivity.html), in particular pay attention to the section on Events. The aspects in the aricle that describe mouseOver() and mouseOut() are our of scope for our discussion at the moment, so don't worry if you don't entirely get what it's describing. 
    * **Read** [The Art of Interactive Design Chapter 1](http://proxy.library.nyu.edu/sso/skillport?context=4587). Online access provided by NYU libraries. **Write a response** to this on your blog â€” Crawford defines interaction as something that can happen along a continuum, from a simple switch to a deep and engaging conversation. How do you define interaction? Would you consider a book to be interactive? What about a plant you need to care for? How about a puppy? What about your sketches?
    * **Suggested Reading** [Getting Started With p5.js](https://learning-oreilly-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/library/view/make-getting-started/9781457186769/) Chapters 4-6. Online access provided by NYU libraries.
    * **Create** one of the following and post a link to the sketch on your website
      * Make a clock with p5js. Functions like second(), hour() and minute() are useful here! The clock can be [analogous to a real-world clock](https://p5js.org/examples/input-clock.html) or it could be an [abstract way of telling time](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/855977) 
      * using your mouse and a simple shape (rect, ellipse, arc, triangle, line, polygon), create an interaction that causes the shape to demonstrate an emotion. It could be fear, attraction, desire, exhaustion. Your choice. Obviously mouseX and mouseY are helpful. Examples like this [easing function](https://p5js.org/examples/input-easing.html) might be inspirational, as would notes from the [12 principles of animation](https://vimeo.com/93206523) 
  
* **WEEK 3 - September 23**
  * review your work
  * question & answer time! nothimng should be unclear after this class ;)
  * you down with oop? A brief introduction to making objects in p5js
  * _Assignments_
    * **watch** [videos on objects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnkvii1uWBvHpcbXFMlbSsCys2UhtMr7w)
    * **watch** the [video on arrays](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnkvii1uWBvFGoi0yz3Fx93F4tlsucJ03)
    * **Read** [Objects of Our Affection : How Object Orientsation Made Computers a Meduim](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=769730&ppg=289) by Casey Alt. Online access provided by NYU libraries. It's a denser read than the other things we have enagged with so far, so give yourself some extra time.
    * **Write** a response to Alt's chapter. He argues that computers became "media" and were no longer just big adding machines when data and interface became rolled into one. With your newfound perspective on what object oriented programming _is_ thanks to the videos above, how do you think this changed computation? What does this provide you? How can you see this being useful?
    * **suggested reading** [Getting Started With p5.js](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=4333728&ppg=173) Chapters 10 & 11. Online access provided by NYU libraries.    
    * **Watch** [the video for Around the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKYPYj2XX80) by Daft Punk. While you're enjoying the music, think about how each of the different dancers/monsters in the video are like an object. They are similar, but have their own behaviors. **Create** a sketch that has a dance party. Use multiple instances of a class, or create multiple classes and many objects thsat have their own dance party. Your idea of a dance party may not have actual bodies, that's ok. Explore different kinds of ways of creating objects with unique behaviors. Post this on your class site.
    
* **WEEK 4 - September 30**
  * [Bradford Paley's CodeProfiles](http://wbradfordpaley.com/live/#)
  * questions and answers about objects and arrays
  * organizing your code into multiple files - aka bliss
  * a bit about pseudocode
  * _Assignments_
    * **watch** [these 4 short videos about debugging](https://vimeo.com/channels/debugging) It's about code _and_ hardware, but it's super useful for orienting yourself mentally to tackle this stupid important process 
    * **read** [the p5js guide on debugging](https://p5js.org/learn/debugging.html)
    * **watch** [Objects talking with other objects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnkvii1uWBvEF5xAptvHOpn7tXpDvBKty)
    * **watch** [More about arrays](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnkvii1uWBvFGoi0yz3Fx93F4tlsucJ03)
    * **Create** a sketch that adds objects based on interaction (mousepress, keystroke, etc) that interact with each other (collision, repulsion, etc.) _or_ create a sketch that makes faces which have multiple dimensions of variability (skin color, eyes, ears, mouth, hair, age, etc). A new face should eb created everytime you click the mouse. For either example, write the sketch as pseudo-code first, then fill in your code afterwards.
