# Process Website

Please add your name and the URL of your process website to this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mKKHRFi-W3GdVgWUSxoPL---7qcGSEt6qx7Z2y-83T4/edit?usp=sharing).

You should have a **dedicated**, project website to document your **daily** and/or **weekly** process and progress of your senior project. Students are expected to share their process and progress with others using this "process" website.

* **Ideally under your own domain name with a folder named after your project.** See Spencer's link below under "Example Process Websites". 
  * I recommend [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com) or [Siteground](http://siteground.com) for purchasing a domain and web hosting.
* Second best is hosting on [http://wp.nyu.edu](http://wp.nyu.edu)

## What should your website contain?

* Daily/Weekly project process & progress \(AKA what have you done today or this week?\) 
* at least, 1 post per week DUE by or before noon on Mondays. If it is not posted by noon, you will not receive credit for this week.
* If you do not do anything for the week, write **I did not work on my senior project this week.** You will still get credit as opposed to not posting anything at all.
* The majority of the posts should be your own writing \(well-composed and proofread for impeccable spelling and grammar\).
* Make sure to use tags so that you can group certain kinds of info.
  * [Milestones / tasks](../assignments/personal_kanban.md) that have been completed \(either transcribed or linked from your personal kanban or a screenshot or photo\).
  * Include who or what was involved.
  * Include project progress and prototyping documentation: images, illustrations, audio, video, code, snippets of research, ANNOTATED links, etc. relevant to your thesis. 
  * Accountability partner meeting notes.
  * Document any feedback from interviews, meetings, exhibitions, or presentations about your project.
  * pdfs of any presentations \(annotated\).
  * Notes taken about your project, prototypes, and presentations by you or your accountability partner.
  * Notes on problems, challenges or questions that have arisen in your project development. Discuss what is and what is not working.
* _Sourced & Annotated Research / Reference / Inspiration_
  * Research: If you found projects, books, articles, exhibitions, talks. or other research materials that help with your chosen topic or you conducted materials, tech, or visual research, provide a link to them \(if applicable\), photo or video documentation \(if applicable\), and a short written description of it and how you will use this research for your project.
  * Sourced means where did you get this from? if it is a website, provide a link. If it is a book, provide a bibliography. If it is an image, where did you get it from? If it is a quote, who said it or who did you poll or interview?
  * Annotated means with notes. You don’t have to write a novel. 1 to 2 thoughtful, contextual sentences is more than enough. So, “This was inspirational,” would not be a good note as it provides no context for your thesis. However, “This book discusses how nostalgia is a useless emotion because nostalgia is based on the past. This point of view is antithetical to my thesis because I’m trying to demonstrate how the sentimentality of nostalgia is valuable to the human experience.” is a viable note.\)
* _An About Page_
  * Your project themes in 1 to 3 hashtags
  * Your project “elevator pitch” in one sentence
  * Your project description in a paragraph
  * Eventually hi-res image\(s\)

## What your process website should NOT contain?

* How you are feeling about your senior project? This is different than evaluating or reflecting about what is working and what is not working. In other words, don’t rant, complain, blame, self-deprecate or make excuses on your senior project website. 
* This is a public representation of you as an artist, designer, creative technologist and/or entrepreneur. **You want it to be as professional as possible. You want prospective employers, gallery owners, venture capitalists, and/or possible collaborators to take you seriously.**
* Any content that is NOT related to your senior project explicitly.

## Examples of Process Websites

Spencer Hargiss’ process website is a good example, [http://www.spencerhargiss.com/thesis/](http://www.spencerhargiss.com/thesis/). Please use Spencer’s process website as a guide. Why?

* You can clearly read what his project was about due to his about link. You don’t have to wade through to the beginning of his posts to find this out. His navigation stands out due to its visual hierarchy.
* He explicitly stated what he did, concisely and clearly.
* He had visual documentation \(images and screenshots\). 
* However, most importantly, he had supporting text for these images and screenshots.

Also the following pdf contain excellent examples of possible entries:
