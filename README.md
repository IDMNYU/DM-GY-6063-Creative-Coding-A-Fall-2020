### Course Description
This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no prior programming experience. Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result. In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking – to think concurrently and modularly and ask questions about how computation cxan reflect creative potential. By semster end, students are empowered to write and read code for event-driven, object-oriented, experiences and connect them to the physical world.

### IDM Program objectives
Students will:
* Develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities in art and design.
* Develop technical skills to realize their ideas.
* Develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* Gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.
* Develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### LEARNING OUTCOMES:
At the end of the course, students will :
* Understand the basics of creative coding in Javascript using p5.js.
* Write code within the context of visual art and design
* Apply their understanding of digital media to software.
* Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented, real time framework.
* Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project.

### Assignments
Each week you will be asked to write a software sketch (posssibly more than one) and post it to OpenProcessing. You must also write a short blog post about the sketch, and react to any readings that are assigned. Blog posts are to be made on the class site. Work is due before the next class meeting. We will spend time during each class going over the homework, so if you don’t understand a concept, its best to write about that, put up what you attempted to code, and we can use that as a starting point for class discussion.
Late work will be penalized. Every day work is overdue, it loses a letter grade. If work is turned in more than 4 days late, it receives an F. If you turn nothing in at all, you will receive a 0 for the assignment. Nobody wants that, so be sure to turn your work in on time.

### Online Journal:
You are expected to keep an online journal. The purpose of the journal is twofold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate to me that you are keeping up with the work in the class. I read the site to see how you are doing. At a minimum, reference to your work is expected, as well as reference to the readings, and thorough documentation of any research. Secondly, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use and that of others.

You must update the journal weekly with the work you have done for class. It's generally easiest to do this as you do the work.

Document your projects thoroughly as you go; don’t put it off until the end. Photos, video, drawings, schematics, and notes are all valuable forms of documentation. Explain the project at the beginning of your documentation, so that people who come to your site from outside this class can understand your work quickly.

Don’t overload your notes with code. Code repositories like gitHub are best for sharing code, rather than blogs, so post your code to a repository and link to it from your blog. When you base your code on someone else’s code, cite the original author and link to their code, just as you would when quoting another author in a paper. If you only changed one part of an existing program, post only the part you changed, and link to the original. Make sure any code you post is well-commented, so you and others can understand what it does. Copying code or techniques without attribution is plagiarism. Few ideas come out of the blue, and your readers can learn a lot from the sources from which you learned and by which you were were inspired. So be generous in sharing your sources.

Good documentation should include a description and illustration of your project. You should include what it looks like, what it does, what the user or participant does in response. When it’s interactive, mention and show what the user does. Your explanation should give enough information that someone who’s never seen the project can understand it.

You should also include a section describing how the project works, aimed at a more informed reader (your instructor, or next year’s classmates). Include a system diagram to make clear what the major components of the system are and how they communicate.
